# Future of Coding Community Survey

This is a draft of a survey that will be foisted upon our community, with much nagging and reminding. Upon conclusion of the survey, we'll both know a little bit more about who in our community takes surveys, and whether or not we should axe Slack.

Please help improve this survey by adding questions you'd like to see answered by our community, or improving the questions that are already here. In particular, I'd love to see additional questions to help us learn interesting things in aggregate about the FoC work people are doing.

Thank you!

## Put Out The Fire

Thoughts on Slack?
* It holds me back from participating in the community
* I tolerate it but would prefer something else
* Neutral
* It's flawed but is better than the alternatives
* If we move away from it I will probably leave the community

Zulip is a chat service similar to Slack. It has better support for permalinks, threaded discussions, search, and more, with basically all the features of Slack (including desktop, mobile, and web apps). It's actively developed and is growing in popularity. In the conversations leading up to this survey, Zulip was the most popularly recommended alternative to Slack. So, what if we moved the community to Zulip?
* I prefer switching to Zulip
* I prefer staying with Slack
* Neutral — Slack or Zulip, the amount I participate will be the same

Discourse is like a traditional message board, but features a modern visual design and a fair bit of JavaScript-powered dynamism. It is actively developed and is already quite popular. In the conversations leading up to this survey, it was the second most popularly recommended alternative to Slack. Unlike Slack and Zulip, it is a message board rather than a chat service, which will change the tone, length, and frequency of posts to the community. So, what if we moved the community to Discourse?
* I prefer switching to Discourse
* I prefer staying with Slack
* Neutral — Slack or Discourse, the amount I participate will be the same

The third option is a traditional server-driven message board / forum, something like phpBB. This option is appealing if you prefer a message board to chat (with all the changes to tone, length, and frequency of posts it'll bring), but do not like the modern design or JavaScript features of Discourse (which sometimes get in the way more than they help). So, what if we moved the community to a traditional message board / forum?
* I prefer switching to a forum
* I prefer staying with Slack
* Neutral — Slack or forum, the amount I participate will be the same

Now that you've seen the options, what are your top picks?
* Slack
* Zulip
* Discourse
* Forum
* Anything, I'm easy
* Other (fill-in)
